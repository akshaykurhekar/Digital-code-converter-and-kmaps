            The code converters are used to convert the information in to the code which we want. These are basically encoders and decoders which converts the data in to an encoded form. The below explains some digital codes used in digital electronics.

            In decimal using symbol (9)d. Same is coded in natural-binary as (1001)b. While digital computers all deal with binary numbers, there are situations wherein natural-binary representation of numbers in in-convenient or in-efficient and some other (binary) code must be used to process the numbers.

          Code conversions are most commonly used in computers, digital electronics, and microprocessors, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are numerous codes like binary, octal, hexadecimal, Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), Excess-3, Gray code, Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) and ASCII code, etc.

        <p>
          Conversion of signals, or groups of signals, in one code into corresponding signals, or groups of signals, in another code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          A process for converting a code of some predetermined bit structure, such as 5, 7, or 14 bits per character interval, to another code with the same or a different number of bits per character interval.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of these other code is gray-code, in which any two numbers in sequence differ only by one bit change.
          <br><br>This code is used in K-map reduction technique.<br><br> The advantage is that when numbers are changing frequently, the logic gates are turning ON and OFF frequently and so are the transistors switching which characterizes power consumption of the circuit;
          <br><br> since only one bit is changing from number to number, switching is reduced and hence is the power consumption.
