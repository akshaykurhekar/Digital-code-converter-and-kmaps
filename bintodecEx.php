    <br><br>
	<ol style=" margin-left: 5rem; line-height: 2rem;">
		<p>Converting from binary to decimal involves multiplying the value of each digit (i.e. 1 or 0) by the value of the placeholder in the number<br>
        <br>
        <p >

            <li>Write down the number.</li>
            <li>Starting with the LSB, multiply the digit by the value of the place holder.</li>
            <li>Continue doing this until you reach the MSB..</li>
            <li>Add the results together.</li> 
            <br>
            <p>The binary number 1011011 can be written as 1011011 base 2 to explicitly indicate the base. Similarly 54 base 10 can be written 54 base 10 Often however, the subscript is omitted to avoid excessive detail when the context is known. Usually subscripts are only included in explanatory text or notes in code to avoid confusion if several numbers with different bases are used together.
